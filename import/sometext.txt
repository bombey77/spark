I'm not looking for words
I'm not running from hurt
I just want you by my side

In this moment in time
Feels I'm crossing a line
I'm not looking to set things right

This tear I cry
Falls like healing rain,
Softly soothes my pain,
This surrender it feels like I'll...

Kiss the feathers of a hummingbird in flight
Breaking up into a million specks of light
Take the shape of an angel in the night
Carry you to peaceful fields.

My home is my skin
And in the world I've within
All I have is my love for you

If I conceal my fear
Will I be in the clear
Or am I giving life to phantom pain?

Cos it's playing out
Every note in the score
I surrender once more
But as my tears fall they still...

Kiss the feathers of a hummingbird in flight
Breaking up into a million specks of light
Take the shape of an angel in the night
Carry you to peaceful fields.

Grant me one wish,
Send me one more kiss,
On the whispering wind.
Like white horses
Running in the fields
Something new begins.

This tear I cry
Falls like healing rain,
Softly soothes my pain,
This surrender it feels like I'll...

Kiss the feathers of a hummingbird in flight
Breaking up into a million specks of light
Take the shape of an angel in the night
Carry you to peaceful fields,
In your dreams of peaceful fields...

In your dreams of peaceful fields...
